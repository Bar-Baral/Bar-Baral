		<h2>About</h2>
		</center>
		<p>Bar-Baral is an Oligarchy, but we do not hand power to those with wealth or influence, instead, Council members are picked if they are a good candidate for their position.
		Bar-Baral is run by a council with multiple branches, controlled by their respective leaders. We strive to create a place for everyone, where there is truly justice and peace.<p>
     <p>Bar-Baral is an online Micronation, hosted on a Discord server. If you decide to join us, the invite link is: https://discord.gg/jTaFgBSCzE</p>
		<p>When joining, please read the laws, your rights, and apply for citizenship. The process for receiving and requesting citizenship and identification is not difficult, nor is it lengthy.</p>
		<p>Any issues should be brought up with the Council. The Council can be reached through the Discord server, and most likely a support form that will be on this website at a later date. If there was a thought about why we implemented communist viewpoints and ideas, it is not evil as you may have been told. It all depends on the people in power. While we do use communism, we also have viewpoints and ideas from capitalism. We believe that both communism and capitalism are needed for a properly functioing society.</p>
