		<h2>About</h2>
		</center>
		<p>Bar-Baral is an Oligarchy, but we do not hand power to those with wealth or influence, instead, Council members are picked if they are a good candidate for their position.
		Bar-Baral is run by a council with multiple branches, controlled by their respective leaders. We strive to create a place for everyone, where there is truly justice and peace.<p>
     <p>Bar-Baral is an online Micronation, hosted on a Discord server. If you decide to join us, the invite link is: https://discord.gg/jTaFgBSCzE</p>
		<p>When joining, please read the laws, your rights, and apply for citizenship. The process for receiving and requesting citizenship and identification is not difficult, nor is it lengthy.</p>
